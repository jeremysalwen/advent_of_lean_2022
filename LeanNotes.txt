- Docs (https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/) don't distinguish between functions and theorems.
  it would be nice to be able to filter by one or the other.
- String functions are all using `partial` which makes them unamenable to proving.
- List and Array conversions don't seem to be simplified away
- List.split is tail recursive so harder to prove with.
